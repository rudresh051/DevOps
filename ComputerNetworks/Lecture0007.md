## Question 1

**Remember - Normal procedure is if we do Anding of IP address with subnet mask we will get the subnet ID.**

Shortcut - After identifying which class the IP address belongs, then we can easily identify from extra bits. But first find the subnet ID bits from subnet mask.

## Question 2

above can be done by finding the subnet ID by ANDing the IP with subnet mask which will give subnet ID. but that is long process.

shortcut - just take the 3rd octet of each IP.
write down the subnet ID from subnet mask.
then how will you write 38, 48, 68 from its 4 bits which are 1's in subnet ID(basically starting from 128...1)
