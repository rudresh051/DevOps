## Lec-9: Types Of Cables in Computer Networks | Coaxial, twisted pair, fibre optic cable
Cables  
* Unshielded twisted pair cable
  * 10 Base T (10 Mega bits per second(Mbps))
    * Base band - At a time only one signal can go. Else there will be collision
    * Broad band - Multiple signal parallally can move
  * 100 Base T
  * T denotes 100 meters. After 100 meters signal will be Attenuation. So it is used in Ethernet LAN
* Coaxial cable
  * 10 Base 2 
  * 10 Base 5
* Fibre optic - 100 Base Fx
  * Here we have light signals instead of electrical signals. Speed of light is 3 x 10^8 m/s

* Cables work only in Physica layers
