# Computer Networks 15 | Delay in Computer Network

* **Bandwidth** - Bandwidth represent the rate at which no. of bits **placed on the link** in one sec.
* **Velocity** - Represent the rate, distance covered in one sec.


## Example for above

1 bit is put on the link in one second. for 100 bits it will be 100 seconds. And last bit travel time is taken(why) to transfer from A to B which is 3 second.

## Delay in Computer Network
1. Transmission delay - T<sub>d</sub>
2. Propagative delay - P<sub>d</sub>
3. Queuing delay - Q<sub>d</sub>
4. Processing delay - Pr<sub>d</sub>

## Transmission delay - 
Time taken to transfer a packet **on to the outgoing Link** is called as Transmission delay
> It's basically time taken to transfer th packet to the link

Example 2 -

Now what will be the generalize formula for Transmission delay?  

**Transmission delay = Packet Size or Length of the packet/Bandwidth**

## Propagative Delay
![alt text](image-365.png)
Here packet travels from A to B

Example -  
 
![alt text](image-366.png)

Propagation delay = Distance/Velocity  
P<sub>d</sub> = d/u
