## Question 2

If IP addresss is given , then जो भी एक्सट्रा 1 है subnet mask में वो SID represent करती है । 

Subnet ID निकालने के लिए Host ID में सारे 1 को 0 कर दो ।

Clear? 

Second part =>  

To write 3rd subnet ID, the last two bits is enough. simply write 10. but we have 6 bits in SID. so write it as 000010  

Now to write the 4th host we need to write 4 in decimal. since when all 0's are present in host ID , then that IP is not assigned to any computer . so counting will start from 00000001  

but we have 18 bits. so to write 4th host simply write it as 00000100
