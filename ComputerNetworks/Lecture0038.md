## Vulnerable Time for Pure ALOHA
* Vulnerable time is the **range of time where collision take place**.

Suppose we have below timeline diagram. let's we divide the time into slots.

what are these slots?
> These slots are transmission time for single frame

**Transmission time for single frame(Tf) = Frame size/Bandwidth**  
**= L/B**  

Tf is transmission time for single frame

With the channel can be any number of system connected. let's say we 3 stations.

![alt text](image-721.png)

let's say we have time 't'.  
back will be t-tf
and front will be t+tf

Let's say we have station B and it start transfer of frame and when it will complete? t+tf

> Question - Now let's say station A or C start transfer of frame like below no collision will happen

![alt text](image-724.png)

But we have a problem. let's say another station start from like below as shown. Now the **A's frame End will collide with B's beginning frame.**

Now let's say station C start from slight earlier from t+tf as shown. then what will happen?

![alt text](image-727.png)

> C's frame beginning will collide with B's End

now what's is vulnerable time? कौन से टाइम में कॉलिसन हो रहा है ।

Collision range = [t-Tf to t + Tf]

**Vulnerable time for Pure ALOHA = 2*Tf**

Another example for collision range

## Throughput of Pure ALOHA

ये फॉर्मूला कहाँ से आया । गेट एग्जाम के लिए जरूरत नहीं है

![alt text](image-654.png)

Maximum throughput of pure aloha = 18.4%  

![alt text](image-730.png)

> One Frame should be generated in two frame transmisson time to achieve maximum throughput. It is nothing but vulnerable time = 2*Tf

* Proof =>

![alt text](image-731.png)

**Note -** 

* If one frame is generated by the network in two frame transmissior time then in this situation we will achieve maximum throughput
* Vulnerable time 2Tf is basically representing if one frame is generated by the network in two frame transmission time then there will be no collision. if there is no collision then we will achieve maximum throughput
