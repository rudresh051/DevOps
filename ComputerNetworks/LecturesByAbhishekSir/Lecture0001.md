# Computer Network 01 : OSI and TCP/IP Model In One Shot

## Topic - Reference
* Request for Comments(RFC) by Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF)

## Topics to be covered
1. Circuit and Packet Switching
2. TCP/IP Model
3. OSI Model

## Topic : Syllabus
1. Concept of layering - OSI and TCP/IP Protocol Stacks
2. Basics of packet, circuit and virtual circuit switching

## Topic : Switching
* Process to **move data(or packets)** towards destination over the network
* Types of switching techniques - 
  * Circuit Switching
  * Packet Switching

## Topic : Circuit Switching
* **Establishes dedicated circuit** between **sender** and **receiver**, before transmission[over the links of the network]
* Example : Telephone Networks
  * PSTN - Public Switched Telephone network
* Advantage - 
  * **No any congestion occur**, during **data transfer**[**Congestion** may occur during **circuit establishment**]

"All lines of this route are currently busy"

* Disadvantage
  * **Inefficient utilization** of **network resources**
  * **Expensive**
  * e.g. Analogy - A single person drives a whole car for travelling to work
