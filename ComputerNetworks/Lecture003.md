1. Unicast communication(1 to 1)
2. Broadcast communication(1 to all)
3. Multicast communication(1 to many)

## Unicast Communication

## Broadcast communication(1 to all)
Two types -  
1. Limited Broadcasting

**Limited Broadcasting** -   
Transmitting data from **one** computer to **all other** computer in the **same network** is called as Limited Broadcasting

Note - Whenever we have all 1's in HID part of any IP address, that IP address represents the direct broadcast address so this is the reason we can't assign this IP address to any host
