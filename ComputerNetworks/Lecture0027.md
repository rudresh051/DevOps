1. The application that required one request one reply. TCP is not suitable hence we use UDP
   * Analogy - Asking a time from someone. no need to connection
   * e.g. DNS is one request one reply.

   1. e.g. watching video on YouTube. In HD video is TCP
4. 
5. -
6. UDP is used for some route updating protocol such as RIP
7. For **broadcasting & multicasting application** TCP is not suitable hence we use UDP 
8. UDP is normally used for interactie real time applications
9.  UDP is suitable for a process with internal flow error control mechanisms. For example, the Trivial
