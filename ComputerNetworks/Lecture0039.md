## CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access)

* To minimize the chances of collision CSMA method was developed
* Chances of collision can be reduced if **station sense the medium or carrier before trying to use it.**
* CSMA requires that each station , first sense the the carrier before transmit the data

## How To sense the Medium?

* Each station can sense the carrier only at its point of continuous carrier.
* It is not possible for any station to sense the entire carrier.
* Thus, there is a huge possibility that a station might sense free when it is actually not.
