## Resource Hierarchy

In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the resource hierarchy helps organize and manage GCP resources (like VMs,   buckets, etc.) systematically, especially in large organizations. It allows setting permissions (IAM) and   policies at different levels.

1. Organization (optional, for large companies)  
   ‚Üì
2. Folders (optional, used to group projects/departments)  
   ‚Üì
3. Projects (mandatory, main container for resources)  
   ‚Üì
4. Resources (e.g., Compute VMs, Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, etc.)  

1. **Service-level resources**
   1. Compute Instance VM's
   2. Cloud Storage buckets
   3. Cloud SQL databases

2. **Account-level resources**
   1. Organization
   2. Folders
   3. Projects

* Designed to map organizational structure to Google Cloud
* Better management of permissions and access control
* Policies controlled by **IAM**
* **Access control policies** and **configuration settings** on a parent resource are inherited by the child
* Each child object has exactly **one parent.**
* **Labels** - Categorize resources

## Securing Your Account 

* Security Key, Google Authenticator, Text, voice, Google prompt by 2 step verification
* Username + passwod + 2 Step verification
* Demo

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** is a security method that requires **two different types of verification** to confirm your identity when logging into an account or system. The goal is to make it harder for someone to gain unauthorized access‚Äîeven if they know your password.

### The Two Factors Typically Include:

1. **Something You Know** ‚Äì like your password or PIN.
2. **Something You Have** ‚Äì like a phone, authenticator app, or hardware token.

---

### üîê Example:

When you log in to your email:

1. You enter your **password** (something you know).
2. Then, you're asked to enter a **code sent to your phone** or generated by an app like Google Authenticator (something you have).

---

### ‚úÖ Common 2FA Methods:

* SMS code sent to your phone
* App-generated code (e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator)
* Email verification code
* Biometric (like fingerprint or face ID, sometimes considered a third factor)

---

### üöÄ Why Use 2FA?

Even if a hacker steals your password, they **can‚Äôt access your account without the second factor**, making it a simple but powerful way to secure your online identity.
