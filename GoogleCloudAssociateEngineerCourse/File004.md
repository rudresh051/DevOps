# Account Setup

## Resource Hierarchy

In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the resource hierarchy helps organize and manage GCP resources (like VMs,   buckets, etc.) systematically, especially in large organizations. It allows setting permissions (IAM) and   policies at different levels.

1. Organization (optional, for large companies)  
   ↓
2. Folders (optional, used to group projects/departments)  
   ↓
3. Projects (mandatory, main container for resources)  
   ↓
4. Resources (e.g., Compute VMs, Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, etc.)  

1. **Service-level resources**
   1. Compute Instance VM's
   2. Cloud Storage buckets
   3. Cloud SQL databases

2. **Account-level resources**
   1. Organization
   2. Folders
   3. Projects

* Configure and grant access to the various resources
* Resource Hierarchy Structure

* Resources are organized hierarchically using a parent/child relationship

![alt text](image-11.png)

* Designed to map organizational structure to Google Cloud
* Better management of permissions and access control
* Policies controlled by **IAM**
* **Access control policies** and **configuration settings** on a parent resource are inherited by the child
* Each child object has exactly **one parent.**
* **Labels** - Categorize resources

## Securing Your Account 

* Security Key, Google Authenticator, Text, voice, Google prompt by 2 step verification
* Username + passwod + 2 Step verification
* Demo

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** is a security method that requires **two different types of verification** to confirm your identity when logging into an account or system. The goal is to make it harder for someone to gain unauthorized access—even if they know your password.

### The Two Factors Typically Include:

1. **Something You Know** – like your password or PIN.
2. **Something You Have** – like a phone, authenticator app, or hardware token.

---

### 🔐 Example:

When you log in to your email:

1. You enter your **password** (something you know).
2. Then, you're asked to enter a **code sent to your phone** or generated by an app like Google Authenticator (something you have).

---

### ✅ Common 2FA Methods:

* SMS code sent to your phone
* App-generated code (e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator)
* Email verification code
* Biometric (like fingerprint or face ID, sometimes considered a third factor)

---

### 🚀 Why Use 2FA?

Even if a hacker steals your password, they **can’t access your account without the second factor**, making it a simple but powerful way to secure your online identity.

## GCP Console Overview
The GCP Console (https://console.cloud.google.com) is a web-based graphical user interface provided by Google to manage cloud resources and services. It allows users to create, configure, monitor, and manage everything from virtual machines and databases to AI models and billing.

## Cloud Billing

![alt text](image-17.png)
* Defines **who pays** for a given set of Google Cloud resources
* Tracks all **costs incurred** by Google Cloud usage
* Linked to a **Payments profile**
* Can be **linked to one or more projects**
* Billing specific **roles and permissions** to control access.
* **Self-service**(online) or **Invoiced** (offline) payments available
* **Sub-accounts** can be used for resellers
* Billing account can **pay for projects** in a **different organization**
* Projects that are **not linked** to a cloud billing account **cannot use paid Google Cloud services**

```txt
creating, editing and closing a new billing account
Linking and Unlinking a project - to and from a different billing account

```

### Payments Profile
* **Processes payments** for all Google services
* **Stores** all **payments methods**
* Single pane of glass for **viewing invoices** and **payment history**
* **Controls who can** view and receive invoices
* **Individual** or **Business** profile types - **cannot be changed**
  * Business profile gives more flexibility
  * Once a profile type is selected, it cannot be changed afterwards

* Create a new billing account, edit that billing account, close a billing account

Question - What are the different functions of roles present in billing 

![alt text](image-19.png)

* Navigate to hamburger menu >> billing >> scroll down to bottom of sidebar >> account management
  * First unlink the project and then close the billing account
* Google also gives option for reopen the billing account if you accidently close it.

usage, cost details, and pricing data) to be **exported
automatically to BigQuery** for detailed analysis
* Not retroactive

## Cloud SDK and CLI
* CLI guide - https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud
* Set of **command line tools** that allow you to manage resources through the terminal
  * gcloud
  * gsutil
  * bq
  * kubectl

* A user account is a Google account that allows end-users to authenticate directly to your application. For most common use cases on a single machine, using a user account is best practice.

* A service account is a Google account associated with your GCP project and not a specific user. A service account can be used by providing a service account key to your application and is recommended to script Cloud SDK tools for use on multiple machines.

* **Gcloud Init** - Authorizes access and performs other common Cloud SDK setup steps.
* **gcloud auth login** - Authorize access for gcloud with Google user credentials
* **Gcloud config** - Allows you to configure accounts and projects
* **gcloud components** - Allow you to install, update and delete the components of the sdk

* Cloud SDK allows to do everything that the console can do, yet it has more options than the console.

* cloud shell provides command line access to google cloud resources within the console.
* Cloud shell also comes with a built in code editor.
* Icon

![alt text](image-53.png)

![alt text](image-54.png)

* cloud shell provisions on e2 google compute engine instance running on a Debian based Linux operating system. 
* Cloud shell instances are provisioned on a per user per session basis.
* The instance persists while your cloud shell session is active and after an hour of inactivity the session terminates and the VM is discared.

![alt text](image-55.png)
* To know where Cloud shell is currently running

`curl metadata/computeMetadata/v1/instance/zone`

![alt text](image-56.png)

## Limits and Quotas
* Google cloud enforces quotas on resource usage for project owners, setting a hard limit on how much of a particular Google cloud resource your project can use.
* API request per day - Resets after specified time
* Allocation quota - Must be explicitly released
* Enforcement of Quotas
  * Protection
  * Resource Management
  * Countable
