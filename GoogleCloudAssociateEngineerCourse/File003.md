# What is Cloud Computing
Noun - 
The delivery of a shared pool of on-demand computing services over the public internet, that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

## The 5 Characteristics of Cloud

* **On-demand Self Service** - Provision resources automatically without requiring human interaction
* **Broad Network Access** - Available over the network
* **Resource Pooling** - Pooled resources to support a multi-tenant model allowing multiple customers to share the same applications or the same physical infrastructure
* **Rapid Elasticity** - Rapidly provision and de-provision any of the cloud computing resources
* **Measured Service** - Resource usage can be monitored, controlled and reported using metering capabilities

## Benefits of Cloud
1. Agility - Flexibility for provisioning resources, Innovate faster
2. Cost - Pay as you go, Trade capital expenditure for variable expense
3. Speed - Resources on demand, Scriptable infrastructure
4. Global - Global data centres, Disaster recovery becomes easier, High availability
5. Security - Always up-to-date, Physical security, Encryption at rest and in transit, Compliance

## Cloud Deployment Models
* **Public Cloud** - 1 public cloud
* **Multi-Cloud** - 2 or more public clouds
* **Private Cloud** - on-premise cloud
* **Hybrid Cloud** - private cloud + public cloud
* **Hybrid Environment** - on-premise data center + public cloud

## Cloud Service Models and Concepts
Referred as XaaS - Anything as a Service

## üîß What Are Cloud Service Models?

Cloud service models define **how services are delivered** over the internet by cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, etc. They describe the **level of control, responsibility, and flexibility** a user has.

There are **3 main cloud service models**:

---

## 1. **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**

### üîç What it means:

You rent **basic IT infrastructure** ‚Äì servers, storage, and networking ‚Äì from a cloud provider. You manage the OS, apps, and runtime.

### üèóÔ∏è You Manage:

* OS (Linux/Windows)
* Applications
* Middleware
* Runtime

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Provider Manages:

* Virtualization
* Servers
* Storage
* Network

### ‚úÖ Use Case:

* Hosting virtual machines
* Storage and backups
* Network configuration

### üõ† Examples:

* **Amazon EC2**
* **Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines**
* **Google Compute Engine**

---

## 2. **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**

### üîç What it means:

You rent a **ready-made platform** to develop, run, and manage applications. No need to handle infrastructure.

### üèóÔ∏è You Manage:

* Applications
* Data

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Provider Manages:

* Runtime
* OS
* Middleware
* Servers
* Networking
* Storage

### ‚úÖ Use Case:

* Rapid application development
* Deploying apps without managing servers

### üõ† Examples:

* **Google App Engine**
* **Heroku**
* **Azure App Services**

---

## 3. **SaaS (Software as a Service)**

### üîç What it means:

You use **ready-made software** over the internet. You don‚Äôt worry about how it‚Äôs built or maintained.

### üèóÔ∏è You Manage:

* Nothing (just use it)

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Provider Manages:

* Everything (app, runtime, OS, infrastructure)

### ‚úÖ Use Case:

* Email, CRM, collaboration tools

### üõ† Examples:

* **Gmail**
* **Dropbox**
* **Salesforce**
* **Microsoft 365**

## üß† Real-Life Analogy:

**Pizza as a Service:**

| Service Model | Who does what?                                            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| IaaS          | You bring ingredients, cook at home (Cloud gives kitchen) |
| PaaS          | You bring toppings, Cloud gives dough, oven, chef         |
| SaaS          | You order a pizza (Cloud does everything)                 |

You're almost there, Rudreshwar! Here's a refined version of your analogy to better align with the actual **IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS** concepts:

---

### Pizza-as-a-Service Analogy:

* **IaaS** ‚Äì *You pick up the raw ingredients or a pizza base and cook it at home.*
  ‚Üí You manage most of the process, but basic infrastructure (kitchen = servers) is provided.

* **PaaS** ‚Äì *You get a pre-made pizza base delivered and just add toppings & bake.*
  ‚Üí The platform is ready; you focus on your application logic.

* **SaaS** ‚Äì *You dine at a restaurant and eat a ready-made pizza.*
  ‚Üí Everything is done for you ‚Äî just consume the service.



# Section 3 - Google Cloud Fundamentals(Overview)
Later we will dive deep into all of these

## 1. Google Cloud Global Infrastructure

![alt text](image-8.png)

* **Zone** - A zone is a **deployment area** for Google Cloud resources **within a region.** The smallest entity in Google's global infrastructure

A  single failure domain within a region Deploy closer to users for optimal latency

* **Region** - Regions are independent geographic areas that are **sub-divided into zones**

* **Multi-Region** - Multi-Regions are large geographic areas, that contains **two or more regions**

## 2. Compute Service Options

![alt text](image-9.png)

### Compute Engine
* Virtual Machines (VMs) called instances, Choose region and zone to deploy , You decide the operating system and the software you decide to put on it
* Use public or private images to create instances
* Pre-configured images and software packages available in Google Cloud Marketplace
* Manage multiple instances using instance groups
* Add/remove capacity using autoscaling with instance groups
* Attach/detach disks as needed
* Can be used with Google Cloud Storage
* Use SSH to connect directly
* Considered to be IaaS

### Google Kubernetes Engine(GKE)
* Container-orchestration system for automating deploying, scaling, and managing containers
* Built on open-source Kubernetes
* Flexibility to integrate with on-premise Kubernetes
* Uses Compute Engine instances as nodes in a cluster.
* A cluster is a group of nodes or Compute Engine instances
* Considered Container as a Service (CaaS)

```txt
1. Think of GKE as an automated factory manager for running many small machines (apps). You tell it what each machine needs ‚Äî like how much power, how many workers ‚Äî and it takes care of organizing and running them without you needing to do it all by hand. It's built by Google to make running big software systems easier.

2. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is a managed Kubernetes service by Google Cloud. It abstracts the complexity of manually setting up a Kubernetes cluster by handling provisioning, scaling, upgrading, and securing the underlying infrastructure. You deploy containers, and GKE schedules, scales, and manages them for you ‚Äî including networking, storage, and monitoring integration.
```
