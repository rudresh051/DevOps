# What is Cloud Computing
Noun - 
The delivery of a shared pool of on-demand computing services over the public internet, that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

## The 5 Characteristics of Cloud

* **On-demand Self Service** - Provision resources automatically without requiring human interaction
* **Broad Network Access** - Available over the network
* **Resource Pooling** - Pooled resources to support a multi-tenant model allowing multiple customers to share the same applications or the same physical infrastructure
* **Rapid Elasticity** - Rapidly provision and de-provision any of the cloud computing resources
* **Measured Service** - Resource usage can be monitored, controlled and reported using metering capabilities

## Benefits of Cloud
1. Agility - Flexibility for provisioning resources, Innovate faster
2. Cost - Pay as you go, Trade capital expenditure for variable expense
3. Speed - Resources on demand, Scriptable infrastructure
4. Global - Global data centres, Disaster recovery becomes easier, High availability
5. Security - Always up-to-date, Physical security, Encryption at rest and in transit, Compliance

## Cloud Deployment Models
* Public Cloud - 1 public cloud
* Multi-Cloud - 2 or more public clouds
* Private Cloud - on-premise cloud
* Hybrid Cloud - private cloud + public cloud
* Hybrid Environment - on-premise data center + public cloud
