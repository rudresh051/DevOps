## Cloud Computing - Essential Characteristics
* On demand self-service

A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as
needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
* Broad network access

Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by
heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).
* Resource pooling

The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model,
with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer
demand.

## Cloud characteristics
* Measured Service

– Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering
capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage,
processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be
– monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and
consumer of the utilized service.
* Rapid elasticity

Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to
scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the
capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be
appropriated in any quantity at any time.
