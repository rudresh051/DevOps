# Cloud Computing - Overview (contd..)

## Distributed applications

* Applications that consist of a set of processes that are distributed across a network Of machines and work together as an ensemble to solve a common
problem
* In the past, mostly "Client-server"
    * Resource management centralized at the server
* "Peer to Peer" computing represents a movement towards more "truly" distributed applications.

Clients invoke individual servers -

## Grid Computing?
* Pewebopedia.com
    * A form of networking unlike conventional networks that focus on conununication
devices, grid computing harnesses unused processing cycles of all computers
in a network for solving problems too intensive for any stand-alone machine.
* IBM
    * Grid ccnnputing enables the virtualization of distributed computing and data
resources such as processing, network bandwidth and storage capacity to create a
single system image, granting users and applications seamless access to vast IT
capabilities. Just as an Internet user views a unified instance of content via the web, a
grid user essentially sees a single, large virtual computer.
* Sum Microsystems
    * Grid Computing is a comnputing infrastructure that provides dependable,
consistent, pervasive and inexpensive access to computational capabilities
