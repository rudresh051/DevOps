# Cloud Computing - Overview (contd..)

## Distributed applications

* Applications that consist of a set of processes that are distributed across a network Of machines and work together as an ensemble to solve a common
problem
* In the past, mostly "Client-server"
    * Resource management centralized at the server
* "Peer to Peer" computing represents a movement towards more "truly" distributed applications.

Clients invoke individual servers -

## Grid Computing?
* **Pewebopedia.com**
    * A form of networking unlike conventional networks that focus on communication
devices, grid computing harnesses unused processing cycles of all computers
in a network for solving problems too intensive for any stand-alone machine.
* **IBM**
    * Grid computing enables the virtualization of distributed computing and data
resources such as processing, network bandwidth and storage capacity to create a
single system image, granting users and applications seamless access to vast IT
capabilities. Just as an Internet user views a unified instance of content via the web, a
grid user essentially sees a single, large virtual computer.
* **Sum Microsystems**
    * Grid Computing is a comnputing infrastructure that provides dependable,
consistent, pervasive and inexpensive access to computational capabilities.

## Electrical Power Grid Analogy
Here's the information from the image in a table format.

| Electrical Power Grid | Grid |
| :--- | :--- |
| Users (or electrical appliances) get access to electricity through **wall sockets** with no care or consideration for where or how the electricity is actually generated. | Users (or client applications) gain access to **computing resources** (processors, storage, data, applications, and so on) as needed with little or no knowledge of where those resources are located or what the underlying technologies, hardware, operating system, and so on are. |
| **"The power grid"** links together power plants of many different kinds. | **"The Grid"** links together computing resources (PCs, workstations, servers, storage elements) and provides the mechanism needed to access them. |

## Grid Computing

1. Share more than information: Data, computing power, applications in dynamic environment, multi-institutional, virtual organizations.
2. Efficient use of resources at many institutes. People from many institutions working to solve a common problem (virtual organisation) .
3. Join local conununities.
Interactions with the underneath lavers
4. Interactions be transparent and seamless to the user.

## Evolution of Cloud computing 

üß¨ 1. Foundations Before the Cloud (1950s‚Äì1990s)

1950s‚Äì60s: Mainframe and Terminal Computing

Centralized computing with dumb terminals connected to powerful mainframes.

Users shared resources, like memory and processing, over time (time-sharing concept).


1970s‚Äì80s: Virtualization Emerges

IBM introduced virtualization with its VM operating system, enabling multiple OSes to run on a single machine.

This laid the foundation for resource abstraction, crucial for cloud models.


1990s: Client-Server & Grid Computing

Rise of client-server architecture, where services were distributed but still needed specific infrastructure.

Grid computing appeared: pooling resources across networks to work on intensive tasks (e.g., scientific research).

‚òÅÔ∏è 2. The Birth of Modern Cloud Computing (2000‚Äì2010)

Early 2000s:

Amazon launched Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2002 (S3 in 2006, EC2 in 2006).

Idea: rent out unused server space as a service.


2006‚Äì2009:

Google introduced App Engine (2008) for deploying applications on their infrastructure.

Microsoft launched Azure (2009).

Introduction of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS:

IaaS ‚Äì Infrastructure as a Service (e.g., AWS EC2)

PaaS ‚Äì Platform as a Service (e.g., Google App Engine)

SaaS ‚Äì Software as a Service (e.g., Gmail, Salesforce)

üöÄ 3. Cloud Expansion and Enterprise Adoption (2010‚Äì2020)

2010‚Äì2015:

Enterprises started migrating data centers to the cloud.

Introduction of hybrid clouds (mix of on-premise + public cloud).

DevOps, CI/CD, and Containers (like Docker) started becoming key to cloud workflows.


2016‚Äì2020:

Rise of Kubernetes and serverless computing (e.g., AWS Lambda).

Emergence of multi-cloud strategies to avoid vendor lock-in.

Major players: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud.



---

ü§ñ 4. Cloud-First and Intelligent Cloud Era (2020‚ÄìPresent)

2020‚ÄìNow:

AI/ML on cloud becomes mainstream (e.g., AWS SageMaker, Azure ML, Google Vertex AI).

Edge computing grows to support IoT and low-latency applications.

Cloud-native development using microservices, containers, and Kubernetes.

Rapid growth in cloud security, compliance, and FinOps.

Sovereign cloud and green computing trends emerge due to geopolitical and environmental concerns.



---

üîÆ 5. The Future of Cloud Computing

AI-integrated cloud agents (e.g., Copilot-like services across clouds).

Quantum computing in the cloud (e.g., AWS Braket, IBM Q).

Fully automated DevOps pipelines with AI.

Rise of industry-specific clouds (e.g., healthcare, finance, manufacturing).

Potential shift toward decentralized computing with blockchain and Web3.
