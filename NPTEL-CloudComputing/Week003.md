# Lecture 11: Service Level Agreement
## What is Service Level Agreement?
* A formal contract between a Service Provider (SP) and a Service Consumer
(SC)
* SLA: foundation of the consumer’s trust in the provider
* Purpose : to define a formal basis for performance and availability the SP
guarantees to deliver
* SLA contains Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
– Objectively measurable conditions for the service
– SLA & SLO: basis of selection of cloud provider

## SLA Contents

## Web Service SLA
1. WS-Agreement
2. WSLA(Web Service Level Agreement Framework)

## Difference between Cloud SLA and Web Service SLA
* QoS parameters
* Automation
* Resource Allocation

## Types of SLA
* Present market place features two types of SLAs
  * Off-the-shelf SLA or non-negotiable SLA or Direct SLA
  * Negotiable SLA

## Limitations
* Service measurement
* Biasness towards vendors
* Lack of active monitoring on customer's side

## Expected SLA Parameters
* IaaS
* PaaS
* SaaS
* Storage as a service

## Cloud Properties - Economic Viewpoint
* Common Infrastructure
* Location independence
* Online connectivity
* Utility pricing
* on-Demand Resources

## Value of Common Infrastructure

## A useful measure of "Smoothness"

## Coefficient of variation Cv
## But what about workloads?
